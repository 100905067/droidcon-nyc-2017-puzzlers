## What is this

This is small set of RxJava and Kotlin puzzlers (code that looks simple but works not as you expect it to)

## What to do

- Clone the repo (to play with code!
- Open it in IntelliJ IDEA
- Find puzzlers in [`puzzlers/src/test/kotlin/com/lyft/droidconnyc2017/puzzlers`](puzzlers/src/test/kotlin/com/lyft/droidconnyc2017/puzzlers) (they're formed as tests)
- Read comment above each puzzler describing what you need to figure out
- Solve as many puzzlers as you can!
- Share your results with link to this repo by mentioning [`@lyfteng`](https://twitter.com/lyfteng) or [`@artem_zin`](https://twitter.com/artem_zin) on Twitter ðŸŽ¤
- You can solve puzzlers with whole team and use it as a little teambuilding event ðŸ˜½
- Good luck and have fun!
